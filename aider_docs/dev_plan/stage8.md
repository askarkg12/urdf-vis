# Stage 8: Final Polish & Cleanup
**Goal:** Address remaining small requirements, clean up code, add documentation.

**PR Focus:** Code quality, documentation, ensuring all MVP requirements are met.
## **Steps:**
### 1. **Ensure Default View:** (FR4.2.2)
- Verify or explicitly set the initial camera view in `vedo` to an isometric perspective after loading the robot. Check `vedo` documentation for camera positioning methods (e.g., `plotter.camera.Azimuth()`, `Elevation()`, `Zoom()`, or `show(interactive=False, camera=vedo.isometric_view())` if applicable on first render).
### 2. **Code Review and Refactoring:**
- Read through the codebase.
- Refactor complex functions or classes for clarity and simplicity.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions.
- Remove unused imports or variables.
### 3. **Add Code Comments:**
- Add comments explaining non-obvious logic, function purposes, and class responsibilities.
### 4. **Update README:**
- Expand the `README.md` with:
    - A brief description of the tool's purpose (MVP).
    - Clear instructions on how to install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    - Instructions on how to run the application (`python src/robot_visualizer/main.py`).
    - Mention the expected location of mesh files (`meshes/` subdirectory).
    - Basic usage instructions (file dialog, sliders, camera controls).
### 5. **Testing Review:**
- Review existing tests for clarity and coverage.
- Add tests for any utility functions or logic paths missed previously.
- Run all tests one last time (`pytest`).
### 6. **Final Check Against PRD:**
- Reread the PRD (`prd_robot_visualizer_mvp`) and manually verify that all functional requirements (Section 4) for the MVP have been met.
